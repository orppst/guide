# Polaris Documentation

 This **Polaris proposal tool documentation** uses the mkdocs material theme which in turn requires python to be installed.

You can find detailed theme instructions in the [mkdodcs material site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

```shell
pip install mkdocs-material
```

## plantuml

Various diagrams are created using plantuml - the markdown plugin for that can be installed with.

```shell
pip install plantuml-markdown 
```

## Running the website locally

Building and running the site locally requires python with the `mkdocs-material`  package installed.

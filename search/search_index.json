For that reason we have provided you with some custom functions to try to help reduce the number of characters required to insert figures. These are namely:</p> <ul> <li>\\onefigure[width]{filename}{caption}</li> <li>\\twofigures[width]{filename1}{filename2}{caption}</li> <li>\\threefigures[width]{filename1}{filename2}{filename3}{caption}</li> <li>\\fourfigures[width]{filename1}{filename2}{filename3}{filename4}{caption}</li> <li>\\textwrapfigure[width]{filename}{caption}{position}</li> </ul> <p>The width parameter is optional but if provided should a decimal number between 0 and 1, defining the width of the figure in terms of the text-width. It defaults to 0.5 for the single figure cases, and is an even division of the total text-width for the multiple figure cases. If supplied, the width parameter for the multiple figure cases applies to each of the images in the figure, rather than the whole figure itself. The astute among you will have deduced then that the product of the width value with the number of figures must not exceed one, else the figures will overflow the text.</p> <p>The filename parameter(s) should match the name of the image file(s) that you wish to insert. You may exclude the dot extension part of the filename, just remember that the filename string parameter is used in the figure label.</p> <p>The caption parameter is the description of the figure you are inserting. Please note captions count towards the characters used so try to be concise. </p> <p>To reference a figure in your text, use the following syntax: \\ref{fig:filename}. Again remember that the 'filename' is literally that which you supplied in the insert figure command. For the  multiple figure cases, the 'filename' should be the name of the first filename parameter. There is one,  edge-case issue with this labelling strategy. If you have a single figure that uses an image file repeated as the first image in a multiple figure command, you'll get a naming conflict. The most straightforward  way around this issue would be to exclude the dot extension for one of the filenames. If you're including the same image in more than two figures (I mean, WHY!?) then you could upload  the image with different filenames such that the figure labels will be different.</p> <p>Notice that the two figure and three figure functions will place the images in a single row, whereas the four figure function will place the images in a two-by-two arrangement. For the multiple figure functions, each image will be labelled '(a)' through '(d)' where appropriate.</p> <p>If the multiple figure-caption layout is not to your liking, or you have more than four images to place in a figure, then you can always create your own multiple figure as a single image file and use the \"onefigure\" command.</p> <p>For the 'textwrapfigure' command an additional parameter specifies the position of the figure you want to text-wrap. Either 'l' or 'L' for the image on the left, or 'r' or 'R' for the image on the right. The uppercase version allows the image to float, whereas the lowercase version means exactly here. (Our command uses the 'wrapfigure' environment from the 'wrapfig' package).</p> <p>Of course, you can entirely ignore these custom insert figure functions and use the standard Latex syntax for inserting figures (using the 'graphicx' package). </p>"},{"location":"Observer/Justifications/#compiling-your-justification","title":"Compiling your Justification","text":"<p>To compile your Justification document click the Compile to PDF button.

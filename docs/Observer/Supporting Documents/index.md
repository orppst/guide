If you have made reference to any document in your justifications that is not a "resource file"
(images and the bibliography file), then you should upload them
in the **Documents** section of the proposal. Please notice that your image files and bibliography file
used in your justifications are considered **Supporting Documents** so will appear in the list. If you
have successfully compiled the justification document, "compiledJustification.pdf" will also appear
in the list. The following screenshot shows the **Documents** upload page:

File size is restricted to a **maximum of 10 MB**, but you can upload as many files as you like up to
the storage limitations for a proposal (which is sufficiently large).

Any specific additional information that is required by an observatory should be uploaded to **Polaris** 
as a **Supporting Document**. The filename and format of that document should be advertised by the 
observatory (or organization) to which you are submitted the proposal. For further information about 
this see [here](../../Organization%20Specifics/index.md).

If you haven't already, please now follow the guide here about managing [**Investigators**](../Investigators/index.md).

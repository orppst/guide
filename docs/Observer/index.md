# Tools for Observers

Observers will mostly interact with Polaris via the [web based GUI](../prototype_information.md)


There is also a [Front end CLI](https://github.com/orppst/pst-cli-app)  under development which will offer a way of manipulating proposals via scripting.


You can find instructions on creating your first proposal [here](Creating%20Proposals/index.md).

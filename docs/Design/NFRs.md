## *Assumptions and Dependencies*

### *AAI system*

Creates Polaris account for applicant.

AAI does little if any checking, we would like it to check the applicantâ€™s email address and membership of an academic institution.


## *Interfaces to other systems*

Polaris will import proposals in the approved Polaris Exchange Format from any external system 

Polaris will export proposals to any external system in the approved Polaris Exchange Format

## *Volumes*


Here are the usage estimates for the expected lifetime of the PST

discrete users : in 1000s

concurrent users : in 10s (near submission time)

proposals and rate of creation : proposals in 1000s and maybe 100s per day (near submission time)

investigators per proposal : 1-10

observations per proposal : typically only a few if single target - however could be 1000s for surveys

spectral and timing windows per target per proposal : a few

document numbers and volume per proposal : < 10 (documents are intended to be images to be included in the justifications)

required equipment per proposal : 

observatories and organisations taking part : perhaps 10

TACs per observatory : typically only one

equipment and its spectral windows, arrays, and configurations per observatory :

submitted proposals per observatory per cycle : 10s - 1000s

allocated proposals per observatory per cycle :10s-100s


## *Dependencies*

AAI grants access to Polaris to prospective users. We would like it to verify their email address and membership of a recognised academic institution before doing so.

Polaris does not have access to observatory schedules, so revoking an allocation will be a decision made by the TAC who does, but the decision will be captured in Polaris

**Polaris** was designed to capture general information about an observing proposal both for the Radio 
and Optical astronomy communities. As such it cannot capture all the specific details required by 
a particular observatory or organization (here we use the words "observatory" and "organization" 
interchangeably). Users of **Polaris**, or **Investigators** as they are known in Polaris, must supply 
additional information that cannot be captured in general. 

We expect that a particular observatory, using **Polaris** as their proposal preparation tool, will 
communicate what additional information they require, perhaps in the form of questions, to their 
investigator communities. **Investigators** then supply the additional details via upload of a 
**Supporting Document** to the relevant **Observing Proposal** in **Polaris** (the filename and format 
of that document specified by the observatory) before they submit said proposal. 

Please notice that in the current version of **Polaris**, there is no check of the existence of this 
additional information when submitting a proposal. The responsibility for discovering what additional 
information is required by an observatory and actually providing those details falls on to the 
**Investigators**. 

Here we provide details about the organizations currently using **Polaris** as their observing
proposal preparation tool, with links to their websites where you should find the details about any
additional information they require.

## Overview

[**e-MERLIN**](https://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/) stands for _enhanced_ Multi Element Remotely Linked 
Interferometer Network and forms part of the Very Long Baseline Interferometer (**VLBI**) network based 
at the Jodrell Bank Observatory (**JBO**) in the UK. It is operated by the 
[University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) on behalf of the 
[Science & Technology Facilities Council](https://www.ukri.org/councils/stfc/) (**STFC**).

**e-MERLIN** consists of an array of seven radio telescopes spanning approximately 217 km across the UK
connected by an optical fibre network to its base at **JBO**. It forms a core part of the [European Very
Long Baseline Interferometer Network](https://www.evlbi.org/) (**EVN**) providing the shortest baselines
to astronomers. Additionally, the **e-MERLIN** array is also versatile enough to perform sensitive pulsar
observations in very-high time-resolution modes.

**e-MERLIN** regularly operates its wideband correlator in three modes:
e-MERLIN Imaging Mode, e-MERLIN+EVN Mode, and Fast Transient Mode (LoFT-e).
Three observing bands are available:
L band (1.23 - 1.74 GHz), C band (4.3 - 7.5 GHz), and K band (19 - 25 GHz). More details about these
modes and bands, and other information, can be found at the 
[**e-MERLIN** site](https://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/).

## Polaris and e-MERLIN

**e-MERLIN** now uses **Polaris** as its proposal preparation tool. Please go to their 
[website](https://www.e-merlin.ac.uk/) to find what additional information they require that cannot be
captured by **Polaris**.

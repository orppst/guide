# Using the POLARIS Prototype

There is a deployed prototype of the [Polaris web interface](https://kilburn.jb.man.ac.uk/pst/gui/tool/) that can be used for
experimentation and evaluation. There are some things to be aware of

* The tool is still under development
  * There are many "rough edges"
  * The prototype will be updated with new features at irregular intervals.
  * There is no guarantee that the data in the prototype will be stored long term

## Example Data in the prototype

If you simply want to log in and see an example proposal without registering yourself, then log in as

* username: pi
* password: pi

which logs you in as an example Principal Investigator called "John Flamsteed" who already has one proposal prepared.

Then see [instructions for creating a proposal](Observer/Creating%20Proposals/index.md).

## Polaris use at specific organizations

Please see [Organization Specifics](Organization%20Specifics/index.md) to discover what additional details
organizations using **Polaris** may want to capture about a proposal that cannot be captured by the current
version of **Polaris** in general.

## Providing feedback

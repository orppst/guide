# Using the POLARIS Prototype

There is a deployed prototype of the [Polaris web interface](https://kilburn.jb.man.ac.uk/pst/gui/tool/) that can be used for
experimentation and evaluation. There are some things to be aware of

* The tool is still under development
  * There are many "rough edges"
  * The prototype will be updated with new features at irregular intervals.
  * There is no guarantee that the data in the prototype will be stored long term

## Example Data in the prototype

If you simply want to log-in and see an example proposal without registering yourself, then log in as

* username: pi
* password: pi

which logs you in as an example Principal Investigator called "John Flamsteed" who already has one proposal prepared.

Then see [instructions for creating a proposal](Observer/Creating%20Proposals/index.md).

## Providing feedback

We welcome feedback on Polaris should that be in the form of bug reports or suggestions for improvement.

* bug reports should be logged in this [GitHub project](https://github.com/orppst/pst-gui/issues)
* Suggestions are probably best reported in this [GitHub discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/orppst/discussions)

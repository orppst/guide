\begin{abstract}
The Proposal Data Model (ProposalDM) has been created as an IVOA endorsed data model expressed in VO-DML to represent the metadata involved in creating and assessing
    Observing proposals for time to be allocated at astronomical facilities.

    The Polaris proposal toolkit is a set of services to allow proposals to be created and managed via web services APIs that can be accessed via a GUI or the
    commandline clients that are also part of the toolkit.
    The Polaris toolkit uses the ProposalDM at its native internal data model.

% These lines show examples of subject index entries. At this stage these have to commented
% out, and need to be on separate lines. Eventually, they will be automatically uncommented
% and used to generate entries in the Subject Index at the end of the Proceedings volume.
% Don't leave these in! - replace them with ones relevant to your paper.

\section{Motivation}
        Funding was obtained as part of the joint activity 2.1 of the \href{https://www.orp-h2020.eu}{Opticon RadioNet Pilot (ORP)} to create
        a new proposal preparation tool that would make it easier for astronomers to be able to participate in so-called
        multi-facility calls.
        Explicit in the funding request was the aim of creating a data model (in a similar fashion to\cite{10.1117/12.789262}) that could be used to describe the observation proposals
        in as general way as possible to cover a common set of requirements from as many different observatories and observing modes.
        That data model could  then be used as the basis for creating a toolkit for managing proposals.

        This poster describes the data model, called ProposalDM, and another poster \citep{p103_adassxxxiv} describes the toolkit, called Polaris.


        \subsection{Design Goals}
        The Data model is primarily intended to be able to support what is often called "phase 1" of the proposal process, i.e.\ the information
        in the model is sufficient to be able to allocate the observations, but not necessarily complete enough to actually schedule them.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Emphasis on required physics and the science goals.
            \item Flexible enough to use at multiple observatories.
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Implementation}
        The model is expressed in VO-DML and published as an IVOA working draft. It has actually been split into two halves
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The proposal part, which expresses the concepts important to the astronomer principal investigator.
            \item The proposal management part, which expresses the concepts necessary to review and allocate the proposal.
        \end{itemize}
        The two figures show a somewhat simplified view of each of these parts, which despite this, are probably unintelligible on
        this poster!

    \section{VO-DML}
        VO-DML \citep{2018ivoa.spec.0910L} is an IVOA standard for defining data models.
        It has been designed in a way that is more constrained and concise than other generic modelling methodologies such
        as UML, so that it is easy to create models with well defined serializations following IVOA standards.
        There is also some tooling associated with VO-DML (\href{https://github.com/ivoa/vo-dml}{https://github.com/ivoa/vo-dml}) that
        has the capability of generating documentation and source code data objects in Java and Python that allow
        easy serialization to and from XML and JSON as well as object relational mapping to databases.


    \section{Future plans}
        It should be noted that the ProposalDM has not reached the 1.0 status yet as there are still some parts of the model to elaborate.
        In addition it would probably be a good idea to factor out common Observatory, Instrument and Target models to allow re-use elsewhere in IVOA data models.

       The reader is encouraged to follow the web links within this document to learn the latest status of the projects.

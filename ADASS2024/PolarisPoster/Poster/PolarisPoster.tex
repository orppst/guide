                \begin{block}{Motivation}

                    \heading{\emph{NorthStar} is dead}
                    Technically ``end-of-life'', but that just doesn't have the same ring to it.
                    \textbf{\emph{NorthStar}} is the name of a current observation proposal tool used both by the radio
                    and optical astronomy communities.
                    It requires an exorbitant amount of effort to maintain and develop, it is awkward to use for both
                    observatories and astronomers, and is in need of replacement.

                    \heading{Opticon RadioNet Pilot}
                    The \textbf{Opticon RadioNet Pilot (ORP)} aims to support and develop seamless access to
                    \textbf{radio and optical}, ground-based astronomy facilities across Europe and the rest of the
                    world.
                    The \textbf{ORP} attempts to deliver on this aim by developing \textbf{common standards for observation
                    requests and specifications}, as well as a common framework for data access and processing.
                    As part of this pilot we are developing \textbf{a new open source proposal tool} that provides a
                    single access point for the community to create, edit, and submit observation requests to various
                    astronomy facilities.
                    Additionally, the tool provides an interface for \textbf{reviewing and allocating proposals} by the
                    time-allocation-committees (TAC) at the relevant astronomy facilities.

                    \heading{Polaris}
                    We set out to develop a generalised, ``phase 1'' observation proposal tool with
                    \textbf{a modern, open source philosophy}.
                    To that end, our code base is currently version controlled in a
                    \textbf{private repository on GitHub} (see QR-code, bottom right) that we hope remains active for
                    the foreseeable future.
                    Our intention is to allow both the
                    \textbf{observatory and astronomer communities to contribute to the projects},
                    either directly by \textbf{writing and editing source code}, via feedback in terms of
                    \textbf{bug-fixes and feature requests},or to \textbf{fork the projects} to better tailor them to
                    their own needs.

                    As a nod to the outgoing proposal tool, and perhaps signifying progress, we are calling this new
                    proposal tool \textbf{\emph{Polaris}} (\emph{NorthStar++} felt a bit too ``on-the-nose'').

                \end{block}

                \begin{alertblock}{Import and export your proposals}

                    We know that \emph{Polaris} will not be to every one's taste,
                    ``you can't please all of the people all of the time'', somebody famously once said.
                    \emph{Polaris} is designed to capture succinct details about an observation
                    that will allow observatories to deem if it is a suitable use of their facilities.
                    In this respect it is a so called ``phase 1'' proposal tool.
                    Even so, for some observatories, and indeed for some astronomers, \emph{Polaris} will not
                    capture sufficient details about an observation to effectively assess its suitability.

                    \textbf{\emph{Polaris} is built on top of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)
                        Virtual Observatory Data Modelling Language (VO-DML).
                        As such, we have designed \emph{Polaris} to export and import proposals to and from other,
                        perhaps more comprehensive, proposal tools that use VO-DML as their underpinning data modelling
                        language with minimal manual intervention.
                    }

                \end{alertblock}

                \begin{block}{Technologies used to develop Polaris}

                    Let's face it, software developers are lazy beasts.
                    The less code we have to type the happier, in general, we are.
                    If code can be automatically generated, with little to no human involvement then we are
                    all for it (looking at you ChatGPT).

                    The following technologies where use to help develop, build, test, package, and deploy
                    \emph{Polaris} as an observation proposal preparation tool:

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{Quarkus}: a Kubernetes-native Java framework
                        \item \textbf{OpenAPI-codegen}: generate anything from OpenAPI specs
                        \item \textbf{Mantine}: a React components library
                        \item \textbf{Vite}: a build tool for web applications
                    \end{itemize}

                \end{block}

                \begin{block}{Architecture}

                    \insertFigure[width=12cm,height=15cm]{architecture}{The coloured boxes show microservices that can be run on a Kubernetes cluster}

                    Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} shows a diagram representing the architecture of \emph{Polaris}.
                    The functionality of the tool is exposed as a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API),
                    written in Java, as a microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes.
                    The API connects with a Postgres database using the Hibernate query language, and database schemas,
                    generated from the Proposal Data Model, provide the Java class definitions we can work with when
                    writing the implementation of the API calls.

                    We have created a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) frontend to access our API that has been
                    written in Typescript using the React framework.
                    This GUI will be the main access point for those creating, editing, and submitting proposals i.e.,
                    principal investigators (PI) and co-investigators (CI).
                    The GUI accesses the SIMBAD Table Access Protocol (TAP) service as an aid to observational target
                    lookup.

                    We are also actively developing a command line interface CLI, written in Java, to provide a
                    companion access to the API. The intention of this CLI is to provide convenient access for
                    administrators e.g., TAC members, to the configurable parts of Polaris, like the operational
                    details of astronomy facilities.

                    Authorisation to the API is done using KeyCloak and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) server.
                    You can sign-on to \emph{Polaris} using your orcid ID\@.

                        \item access to a spectral line lookup service e.g., Splatalogue

                    An active list of ``issues'' is maintained in each project's GitHub repository containing

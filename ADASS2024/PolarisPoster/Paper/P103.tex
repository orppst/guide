\begin{abstract}
    We are developing a new, open source proposal tool called \emph{Polaris} as a deliverable of the Horizon
    2020 OPTICON RadioNet Pilot project.
    This tool has been built on top of the Proposal Data Model, defined in the IVOA standard VO-DML\@.
    Although this is an important part of the tool, this paper will focus on the technologies
    used build and develop \emph{Polaris}, and its architecture.

    The API, GUI and CLI are maintained in open-source repositories on GitHub.
    This allows others to contribute to the development of Polaris or fork the projects to change the tool
    to suit their needs.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
\emph{NorthStar} is ``end-of-life''.
\emph{NorthStar} is the name of a current observation proposal tool used both by the radio and optical
astronomy communities.
However, there has been a growing need for a replacement, as it has become too difficult to maintain and develop,
and existing deployments rely on old infrastructure.

The Opticon RadioNet Pilot (ORP) aims to support and develop seamless access to radio and optical,
ground-based astronomy facilities across Europe and the rest of the world.
The ORP attempts to deliver on this aim by developing common standards for observation requests and
specifications, as well as a common framework for data access and processing.
As part of this pilot we are developing a new open source proposal tool that provides
a single access point for the community to create, edit, and submit observation requests to various astronomy
facilities.
The tool also strives to provide a uniform and useful interface for reviewing and allocating proposals by the
time-allocation-committees (TAC) at the relevant astronomy facilities.

We set out to develop this proposal tool with a modern, open source philosophy.
To that end, our code base is currently version controlled in a public repository on
GitHub~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/orppst}}, and makes use of ``GitHub Actions'' to perform continuous
integration testing.
Our intention is to allow the user community to contribute to the projects, either directly by writing and
editing source code, via feedback in terms of bug-fixes and feature requests, or to fork the projects to
better tailor them to their own needs.

As a nod to the outgoing proposal tool, and perhaps signifying progress, we are calling this new proposal tool
\emph{Polaris}.

\section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}

Figure~\ref{architectureFigure} shows a diagram representing the architecture of \emph{Polaris}.
The functionality of the tool is exposed as a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) in a
microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes.
The API connects with a \emph{Postgres} database using \emph{Hibernate} as the Object Relational Mapping (ORM) layer.
The database schemas are generated from our proposal data model (see section~\ref{subsec:vodml}), which provides
the Java class definitions we can work with when writing the implementation of the API calls.

\articlefigure[scale=0.5]{P103_architecture.eps}{architectureFigure}{The components that make up the toolkit for \emph{Polaris}}

We have created a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) frontend to access our API that has been
written in Typescript using the React framework.
This GUI will be the main access point for those creating, editing, and submitting proposals i.e.,
principal investigators (PI) and co-investigators (CoI).
The GUI accesses the SIMBAD Table Access Protocol (TAP) service as an aid to observational target lookup.

We are also actively developing a Command Line Interface CLI, both as a stand-alone application and
a python library.
The intention of this CLI is to provide convenient access for administrators e.g., TAC members, to
the configurable parts of Polaris, like the operational details of astronomy facilities.

Authorisation to the API is done using KeyCloak and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) server.
You can sign-on to \emph{Polaris} using your orcid ID\@.


\section{Technologies}\label{sec:technologies}

In modern development of ``full stack'' applications, there is an extensive choice in how you set up your
development environment, and how the application is packaged for deployment.

In this section we discuss some of the technologies used to help develop, build, test, package, and deploy
\emph{Polaris} as an observation proposal preparation tool.

\subsection{VO-DML: Virtual Observatory Data Modelling Language}\label{subsec:vodml}

\emph{Polaris} uses the IVOA Proposal Data Model (ProposalDM) draft standard as its native data model.
This standard is built with the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Virtual
Observatory Data Modelling Language (VO-DML).
Using the VO-DML tooling we can generate the JPA data access classes for use in our API\@.
Using this common standard opens up the possibility of being able to exchange proposal information with
other proposal tools if they implement an import mechanism for the model.


\subsection{Quarkus: a Kubernetes-native Java framework}\label{subsec:quarkus}

Quarkus~\footnote{\url{https://quarkus.io/}}, a ``Supersonic Subatomic Java'', is designed around a
container-first philosophy to develop applications with low memory usage and fast startup times.
It is an open source project with a large community of developers and contributors, and a vast ecosystem
of extensions and plugins.

Using Quarkus allows us to concentrate our development effort on the business logic, user experience, and GUI
without having to spend time on much of the underlying boilerplate work.
Combining Quarkus with Kubernetes is relatively seamless and means Polaris can be deployed on any standard
Kubernetes cluster for high resilience and scalability.

Quarkus comes with a built-in development mode that allows developers to update source, resource, and
configuration files that are then automatically reflected in the running application.

\subsection{OpenAPI: code generation}\label{subsec:openapi-code-generation}

OpenApi-codegen\footnote{\url{https://github.com/fabien0102/openapi-codegen}} can automatically generate the functional components and type schemas from
our Java API code to be used in the Typescript GUI\@.
In other words, it creates the ``fetch'' calls to the REST endpoints that form our API\@.
OpenApi-codegen is mostly automatic, but we have found that it requires some manual effort to correct
the generated code every now and again.
However, overall it has saved developer time and effort, especially when making changes to the API that must be
reflected in the GUI\@.

\subsection{Mantine: a React components library}\label{subsec:mantine:-a-react-components-library}

Mantine\footnote{\url{https://mantine.dev/} - named after a Pok\'emon.} is a React components library that
provides many customisable components and hooks, based in TypeScript, to quickly and easily build accessible
frontend web applications.
It is an open source project that, at time of writing, is actively developed and maintained on GitHub.
We have found Mantine to be an intuitive, comprehensive, well documented, and performant library.
We use Mantine with Vite, a fast build tool for web applications, to build our frontend GUI\@.

\section{Future Developments}\label{sec:future-developments}

In general, we are looking to develop and include the following features in \emph{Polaris}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item a centralised database of observatories and their instruments
    \item a single-sign-on service
    \item a ``plug-in'' feature for exposure/sensitivity calculators
    \item access to a spectral line lookup service e.g., \emph{Splatalogue}
\end{itemize}

Please notice that this list is not exhaustive, nor is it written in any particular order, and should be
out-of-date before long.

An active list of ``issues'' is maintained in each project's GitHub repository containing
bug-fixes and feature requests.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
In summary, we have created a full-stack, web-based, open source observation proposal tool, \emph{Polaris},
for intended use within both the radio and optical astronomy communities.
It is our hope that those communities contribute to the development of \emph{Polaris} such that it remains an
active project on GitHub, and continues to mature into the foreseeable future at least.

\emph{Polaris} will replace \emph{NorthStar} as the de-facto observation proposal preparation tool for
the \emph{eMerlin} facility in the near future.

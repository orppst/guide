\begin{abstract}
    We are developing a new, open source proposal tool called Polaris as a deliverable of the Horizon 2020 OPTICON
    RadioNet Pilot project.
    This tool has been built on top of the Proposal Data Model, defined in the IVOA standard VO-DML. Although this
    is an important part of the tool, this paper will in particular focus on the technologies used build and
    develop Polaris itself.

    We strove to keep the code as lean as possible by utilising code generation and by using existing libraries and
    frameworks.
    The functionality of the tool is exposed as a RESTful API in a microservices architecture deployed
    on Kubernetes.
    We have developed a web-based GUI frontend to access our API. It has been written in Typescript
    using the React framework, specifically leveraging the Mantine library.
    We are also actively developing a CLI in Java to provide companion access to the API\@.

    The API, GUI and CLI are maintained in open-source repositories on GitHub.
    This allows others to contribute to the development of Polaris or fork the projects to change the tool to suit
    their needs.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
North Star is dead.\footnote{ technically ``end-of-life'' but that just doesn't have the same ... drama}
North Star is the name of a current observation proposal tool used both by the radio and optical astronomy communities.
It is no longer actively developed or maintained, it is outdated, and in need of replacement.

The Opticon RadioNet Pilot (ORP) aims to support and develop seamless access to radio and optical, ground-based
astronomy facilities across Europe and the rest of the world.
The ORP attempts to deliver on this aim by developing common standards for observation requests and specifications,
as well as a common framework for data access and processing.
As part of work-package JA2.1 of this pilot we are developing a new open source proposal tool that provides a single
access point for the community to create, edit, and submit observation requests to various astronomy facilities.
The tool also strives to provide a uniform and useful interface for reviewing and allocating proposals by the
time-allocation-committees (TAC) at the relevant astronomy facilities.

To avoid the mistakes of the past we set out to develop a proposal tool with an open source philosophy, making
paramount the ideas of code readability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability.
To that end, our code base is currently version controlled in a private repository on
GitHub~\url{https://github.com/orppst}.
Our intention is to allow the user community to contribute to the projects, either directly by writing and editing
source code, via feedback in terms of bug-fixes and feature requests, or to fork the projects to better tailor
them to their own needs.

As a nod to the outgoing proposal tool, and perhaps signifying progress, we are calling this new proposal tool
Polaris.\footnote{North Star++ felt a bit too ``on-the-nose''.}

\section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}

%TODO: eps figures of architecure/s

\section{Technologies}\label{sec:technologies}

In modern development of ``full stack'' applications, there is an extensive choice in how you set up your
architecture, the libraries and frameworks you can work with, and how it gets deployed on your systems.

In this section we discuss the technologies we choose to develop Polaris.

\subsection{Quarkus: a Kubernetes-native Java framework}\label{subsec:quarkus}

Quarkus \url{https://quarkus.io/} describes its self as a ``Supersonic Subatomic Java'', designed around a
``container-first'' philosophy to develop applications with low memory usage and fast startup times.
It is an open source project with a large community of developers and contributors.

%TODO: more reasons for using quarkus
Blah, blah, blah.

\subsection{OpenAPI: code generation}\label{subsec:openapi-code-generation}

%TODO: reasons for using this code generator
OpenApi-codegen \url{https://github.com/fabien0102/openapi-codegen}  - blah.

\subection{Mantine: a React components library}

Mantine\footnote{named after a Pok\'emon} \url{https://mantine.dev/} is a React components library that provides
many customisable components and hooks, based in TypeScript, to quickly and easily build accessible frontend web
applications.
It is an open source project that is actively developed and maintained on GitHub.
Although there are several choices when it comes to choosing a TypeScript library to develop a frontend, web based,
GUI application (including not choosing one at all), we have found Mantine to be an intuitive, comprehensive, well
documented, and performant library to use.

%TODO: mention 'Vite' here?

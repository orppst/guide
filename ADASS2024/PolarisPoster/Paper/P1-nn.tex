\begin{abstract}
    We are developing a new, open source proposal tool called \emph{Polaris} as a deliverable of the Horizon
    2020 OPTICON RadioNet Pilot project.
    This tool has been built on top of the Proposal Data Model, defined in the IVOA standard VO-DML\@.
    Although this is an important part of the tool, this paper will focus on the technologies
    used build and develop \emph{Polaris} itself.

    The API, GUI and CLI are maintained in open-source repositories on GitHub.
    This allows others to contribute to the development of Polaris or fork the projects to change the tool
    to suit their needs.

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}
\emph{NorthStar} is dead (technically ``end-of-life'', but that just doesn't have the same ring
to it).
\emph{NorthStar} is the name of a current observation proposal tool used both by the radio and optical
astronomy communities.
It is no longer actively developed or maintained, it is outdated, and in need of replacement.

The Opticon RadioNet Pilot (ORP) aims to support and develop seamless access to radio and optical,
ground-based astronomy facilities across Europe and the rest of the world.
The ORP attempts to deliver on this aim by developing common standards for observation requests and
specifications, as well as a common framework for data access and processing.
As part of work-package JA2.1 of this pilot we are developing a new open source proposal tool that provides
a single access point for the community to create, edit, and submit observation requests to various astronomy
facilities.
The tool also strives to provide a uniform and useful interface for reviewing and allocating proposals by the
time-allocation-committees (TAC) at the relevant astronomy facilities.

To avoid the mistakes of the past we set out to develop a proposal tool with an open source philosophy, making
paramount the ideas of code readability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability.
We also hope that our efforts will produce a tool that has longevity.
To that end, our code base is currently version controlled in a private repository on
GitHub~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/orppst}}.
Our intention is to allow the user community to contribute to the projects, either directly by writing and
editing source code, via feedback in terms of bug-fixes and feature requests, or to fork the projects to
better tailor them to their own needs.

As a nod to the outgoing proposal tool, and perhaps signifying progress, we are calling this new proposal tool
\emph{Polaris}(\emph{North Star++} felt a bit too ``on-the-nose'').

We are aware of other such efforts to create observation proposal preparation tools.
Notably, the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO), and the
Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (a.k.a.\ ASTRON) each have their own proposal preparation tools
under development.
[refs???]

Our tool is built on top of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Virtual
Observatory Data Modelling Language (VO-DML).
As such, we are confident that \emph{Polaris} can export and import proposals to and from other tools using
VO-DML as their underpinning data modelling language with minimal manual intervention.

\section{Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}

\articlefigure[scale=0.3]{P1-nn_architecture.eps}{architectureFigure}{Polaris microservices that can be run on Kubernetes clusters}

\clearpage

Figure~\ref{architectureFigure} shows a diagram representing the architecture of \emph{Polaris}.
The functionality of the tool is exposed as a RESTful Application Programming Interface (API) in a
microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes.
The API connects with a Postgres database using the Hibernate query language, and database schemas, generated
from the Proposal Data Model, provide the Java class definitions we can work with when writing the implementation
of the API calls.

We have created a web-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) frontend to access our API that has been
written in Typescript using the React framework.
The TypeScript is transpiled to JavaScript, which calls the REST end-points defined in the API, and produces the
HTML for the application.
Quarkus comes with a built-in development mode that allows live updates to source, resource, and
configuration files that are automatically reflected in the running application, spanning the UI, the API,
and the database.
The GUI accesses the SIMBAD Table Access Protocol (TAP) service as an aid to observational target lookup.
We are also actively developing a command line interface CLI, written in Java, to provide a companion access to
the API. The intention of this CLI is to provide convenient access for administrators to the configurable parts of
Polaris, like the operational details of astronomy facilities.

Authorisation to the API is done using KeyCloak and an OpenID Connect (OIDC) server.
You can sign-on to \emph{Polaris} using your orcid ID\@.


\section{Technologies}\label{sec:technologies}

In modern development of ``full stack'' applications, there is an extensive choice in how you set up your
development environment, and how the application is packaged for deployment.

In this section we discuss the technologies we choose to develop Polaris.

\subsection{Quarkus: a Kubernetes-native Java framework}\label{subsec:quarkus}

Quarkus \url{https://quarkus.io/} describes its self as a ``Supersonic Subatomic Java'', designed around a
``container-first'' philosophy to develop applications with low memory usage and fast startup times.
It is an open source project with a large community of developers and contributors, and a vast ecosystem
of extensions and plugins.
We use Quarkus to help configure and build both the backend service (API, database) and the frontend clients
(GUI, CLI).

Using Quarkus allows us to concentrate our development effort on the business logic, user experience, and GUI
without having to spend time on much of the underlying boilerplate work.
Combining Quarkus with Kubernetes is relatively seamless and means Polaris can be deployed on any standard
Kubernetes cluster for high resilience and scalability.

\subsection{OpenAPI: code generation}\label{subsec:openapi-code-generation}

%TODO: reasons for using this code generator
OpenApi-codegen \url{https://github.com/fabien0102/openapi-codegen}  - blah.

\subsection{Mantine: a React components library}\label{subsec:mantine:-a-react-components-library}

Mantine\footnote{\url{https://mantine.dev/} - named after a Pok\'emon.} is a React components library that
provides many customisable components and hooks, based in TypeScript, to quickly and easily build accessible
frontend web applications.
It is an open source project that, at time of writing, is actively developed and maintained on GitHub.
Although there are several choices when it comes to selecting a TypeScript library to develop a frontend,
web based, GUI application (including not choosing one at all), we have found Mantine to be an intuitive,
comprehensive, well documented, and performant library to use.

%TODO: mention 'Vite' here?

\section{Polaris}\label{sec:polaris}

\subsection{Use Cases}\label{subsec:use-cases}

\emph{Polaris} is split into two main ``views'': the Proposal Editor View, and the Proposals Review
and Allocation View.

\subsubsection{Proposal Editor}\label{subsubsec:proposal-editor}

%TODO: eps figures / screen shots of creating/editing a proposal

The Editor View is where a Principal Investigator (PI) or a Co-Investigator (CI) or investigators may create,
edit, and submit proposals to the various observation proposal cycles that the tool supports.
Observational targets may be looked-up by using an interface to SIMBAD, and in combination with user
supplied desired technical goals (resolution, scale, sensitivity etc.), can be used to create observation
schedules including both the main and calibrator targets.
The investigators may provide scientific and technical justifications for their proposals in either plain text
(ascii), restructured text (RST), or LaTeX format.
A LaTeX ``service'' is provided to compile investigator's LaTeX formatted text, along with uploaded image
and bibliography files, into a PDF document.


\subsubsection{Proposal Review and Allocation}\label{subsubsec:proposal-review-and-allocation}

%TODO: eps figures / screen shots of reviewing/allocating a proposal

The Review and Allocation View is where the TAC may view and/or export submitted proposals for review.
Here the reviewers may supply comments about, and assign a score to submitted proposals that provides a means
to make a decision about the suitability of the proposal in the given observation cycle.
Should a proposal pass the review, it may then be allocated an amount of programmatically defined ``resource''
from the pool or pools of ``resources'' associated with that cycle.
Notice that we assume ``resource'' to be a general, abstract concept, typically observation
time, but could also refer to other types of resource for example, compute resource, or
whatever is appropriate for the observation cycle as defined by the TAC.\@


\section{Future Developments}\label{sec:future-developments}

Some grand-plan, blue-sky (vomit), ideas go here.
A centralised repository/database of observatories and their instruments/detectors.
A standardised list of global astronomy facilities.
Single-sign on feature or service for astronomy.

An active list of ``Issues'' (bugs and feature requests) is maintained on the GitHub repository sites, which
are updated regularly as bugs are fixed and features added.


\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}
In summary, we have created a full-stack, web-based, open source observation proposal tool, \emph{Polaris},
for use within both the radio and optical astronomy communities.
We have approached the design of the application with extensibility and longevity at the forefront of
our plans.
We hope that the radio and optical astronomy communities find our proposal preparation tool useful.
It is our hope that those communities contribute to the development of \emph{Polaris} such that it remains an
active project on GitHub, and continues to mature into the foreseeable future at least.

\emph{Polaris} will replace \emph{North Star} as the de facto observation proposal preparation tool for
the \emph{eMerlin} facility in the near future.
